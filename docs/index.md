# TAP Reference Service Packages

This repository is a collection of reference packages for Kubernetes, aimed at demonstrating
how to consume public cloud services and expose the generated secrets to applications via service bindings.
They are fully compatible with [Services Toolkit for VMware Tanzu Application Platform](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Services-Toolkit-for-VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/index.html).

Either [Carvel](https://carvel.dev/) packages or [Crosspplane](https://crossplane.io/) configurations have been used,
in order to provide examples for both methods.

!!! important
    Such packages are intended to be for reference only and haven't been tested nor are they supported for production use.
